			<h2> Welcome to Our Website</h2><br>
			<p>
				Web content is the textual, visual, or aural content that is encountered<br>
				as part of the user experience on websites. It may include—among other<br>
				things—text, images, sounds, videos, and animations.<br><br>
				While the Internet began with a U.S. Government research project 
				in the late 1950s,<br>the web in its present form 
				did not appear on the Internet until after Tim Berners-Lee <br>and
				his colleagues at the European laboratory (CERN) proposed the concept of linking<br>
				documents with hypertext. But it was not until Mosaic, the forerunner of the famous<br> Netscape Navigator appeared, that the Internet became more than a file serving system.
			</p>	<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Web content is dominated by the "page" concept, its beginnings in an academic<br> setting, and in a setting dominated by type-written pages, the idea of the web <br>
					was to link directly from one academic paper to another academic paper. <br>
				</li><br><br>
				<li>
					This was a completely revolutionary idea in the late 1980s and early 1990s when <br>
					the best a link could be made was to cite a reference in a typewritten paper and<br>
					 name that reference either at the bottom of the page or on the last page of the<br> academic paper.
